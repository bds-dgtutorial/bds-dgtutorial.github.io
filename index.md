## Introduction

Domain Generalization is a fundamental problem in
machine learning today. Despite the fact that
deep learning models have seen immense success in
the past few years even surpassing experts in some
cases they often fail to mimic the adaptability
prowess of humans. The development of highly generalizable
and robust ML models proves to be exceptionally difficult
in numerous cases, as the distribution shifts present across
separate datasets or databases cause a modelâ€™s performance
to deteriorate, or even completely break down, when
evaluated on previously unseen data.
Most ML models depend on the assumption that the test
samples are independent from and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the training data. In practice, even though the independence assumption
commonly holds, the test data often follows
a different data generating distribution than the training data. This creates a need for the development of algorithms which are not affected 
by the distributional shift present in distinct data domains of the same problem - or in other words, *domain generalizable* models. 

This short tutorial serves as an introduction to the field of 
*Domain Generalization* and presents its most important aspects, from problem statement, to state-of-the-art methods and evaluation settings.
